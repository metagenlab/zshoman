# Ze SHOtgun Metagenomics ANalysis pipeline

This pipeline is meant to analyse whole-genome metagenomic data.
For preprocessing the pipeline follows guidelines from [methods in microbiomics](https://methods-in-microbiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preprocessing/preprocessing.html) as well as for [assembly](https://methods-in-microbiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assembly/metagenomic_workflows.html#id1), the [gene catalog](https://methods-in-microbiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assembly/metagenomic_workflows.html#gene-catalogs) and [taxonomic profiling with mOTUs](https://methods-in-microbiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/taxonomic_profiling/metagenomes.html).

The pipeline is meant to handle paired-end and single-end sequencing and analyse not only bacteria, but also viruses and eukaryotes (fungi).

An overview of the pipeline is shown below:

## Running the pipeline

The pipeline needs nextflow 23.10.0 or later to run. You can for example install nextflow with `conda`.
You will also need to clone this repository, and you can then simply run the pipeline (`main.nf`) with nextflow.
Overall the following should work:

```

conda create -n nextflow nextflow -c bioconda
conda activate nextflow
git clone git@github.com:metagenlab/zshoman.git
cd zshoman
nextflow run main.nf --input path/to/samplesheet.csv --db_dir path/to/databases
```

To see the full list of parameters you can use `nextflow run main.nf --help`

### Input

Input is a csv file with 2 or 3 columns:

- sample: label of the samples
- fastq_1: path to forward reads
- fastq_2: optional. path to reverse reads

For single-end samples, the `fastq_2` can be omitted or left empty. The first row should contain the column headers (`sample`, `fastq_1`, `fastq_2`). See the [input template](https://github.com/metagenlab/zshoman/blob/main/assets/input_template.csv) for an example.

### Databases

The pipeline requires various reference databases which are expected to be organised in subdirectories of a single database directory specified with `db_dir`. By default it expects the following organisation:

- `db_dir/phanta/uhggv2_mgv/` which can be downloaded as specified [in the phanta repository](https://github.com/bhattlab/phanta/blob/main/databases.md)
- `db_dir/db_mOTU/` for the motus database which can be downloaded using [the mOTUs software](https://github.com/motu-tool/mOTUs)
- `db_dir/MicroEuk_v3/MicroEuk90.faa.gz` for eukaryotic gene calling, which can be obtained [as explained below](#creating-the-microeuk90-database)
- `db_dir/eggnog/` for the eggnog database, which can be downloaded from the [eggnog website](http://eggnog5.embl.de/#/app/home)
- `db_dir/metagenlab_wgs_pipeline/phix174_ill.ref.fa.gz` for contaminant removal, as obtained from the [methods in microbiomics website](https://methods-in-microbiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/3d3ab63ee68ea60cc2374b0690387094/Sample1_isolate.tar.gz)
- `db_dir/metagenlab_wgs_pipeline/adapters.fa` for adapter trimming, as obtained from the [methods in microbiomics website](https://methods-in-microbiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/3d3ab63ee68ea60cc2374b0690387094/Sample1_isolate.tar.gz)
- `db_dir/metagenlab_wgs_pipeline/hg19_main_mask_ribo_animal_allplant_allfungus.fa.gz` for host filtering (masked human genome which can be obtained [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3llHR93L14wd0pSSnFULUlhcUk/edit?resourcekey=0-PsIKmg2q4EvTGWGOUjsKGQ))

If need be, you can also override the path to each database separately (see [nextflow.config](https://github.com/metagenlab/zshoman/blob/main/nextflow.config) for more details).

### Main options

The pipeline has two main branches, either making a gene catalog and doing functional annotation for that catalog, or making the functional annotation independently for each sample. The former makes comparison of genes between samples easier, but requires rerunning a large portion of the pipeline if a new sample needs to be added. These branches can be skipped with `--skip_gene_catalog` and `--skip_per_sample`. Other parts of the pipeline can also be skipped (see [nextflow.config](https://github.com/metagenlab/zshoman/blob/main/nextflow.config) for more details).


## Running the pipeline on obelix

To run the pipeline on obelix:

- start a `screen` or `tmux`, depending on your religion
- activate nextflow environment `conda activate nextflow`
- run the pipeline `nextflow run /mnt/slow_storage/metagenlab/zshoman_dev/main.nf --input samples_test.csv --db_dir  /mnt/slow_storage/databases/ -resume -c /mnt/slow_storage/metagenlab/configs/conf/metagenlab.config`


## Creating the MicroEuk90 database

For Eukaryotic gene calling we use MetaEuk, which requires a database to match genes against. We propose to use the MicroEuk database from [veba](https://github.com/jolespin/veba). When downloading the database (see https://github.com/jolespin/veba/tree/main/data/MicroEuk_v3) you get a database with all sequences and some files containing clusters for the database clustered at 90% and 50% sequence identity. We propose to use the 90% sequence identity clustering. For this we need to generate the database from the `MicroEuk100.faa.gz` and `MicroEuk90_clusters.tsv.gz` files. This can be easily done by getting the set of unique identifiers from the first column of `MicroEuk90_clusters.tsv.gz`, writing that to a file `MicroEuk90_representatives.csv` and reusing that to filter the database with `seqtk subseq MicroEuk100.faa.gz MicroEuk90_representatives.csv  | gzip --no-name > MicroEuk90.faa.gz`.

## Pre-processing, Post-processing and clean-up scripts

Pre-processing, post-processing and clean-up scripts are python scripts run using the conda environment defined in [post_processing.yaml](https://github.com/metagenlab/zshoman/post_processing/post_processing.yaml).
To run the scripts, simply create the conda environment, activate it and run the script with python:
```
conda env create -f post_processing/post_processing.yaml
conda activate post_processing
python post_processing/annotations.py path/to/pipeline/output
```

You can get help for a given script by passing `-h` then calling the command, e.g.
```
python post_processing/annotations.py -h
```

Here a quick overview of available scripts:
- pre-processing:
  - `download_files.py`: while the pipeline handles genomes hosted on online resources (i.e. the files will get downloaded when executing the pipeline), this can lead to issues as download sometimes fails and the pipeline will need to be restarted. This script allows to download the files in advance, and rewrites the input file to point to the downloaded files.
  - `filter_samples.py`: This script will remove samples for which the analysis is complete from the input file. Can be useful if the pipeline needs to be resumed but nextflow's resume is not available (e.g. because the nf-boost plugin is used to delete intermediary data from the `work` directory)
- post-processing:
  - `annotations.py`: This script will process the output from eggnog and the gene abundances and generate tables containing the annotation abundances.
  - `check_quality.py`: This script will extract information from the log files and prepare summary tables and plots, notably to check the quality of the data and the run.
  - `collect_output.py`: This script will gather output files from the nextflow output directory, copy (and rename them if necessary) to a different location.
  - `merge_output.py`: This script will gather the outputs (for now mOTUs) for all samples from the nextflow output directory, and merge them into a single table.
- clean-up:
  - `clean_up_assembly.py`: This script will remove the files generated by assembly in nextflow's work directory, provided that we do not need them anymore (i.e. we have the files in the output directory).
  - `clean_up_output.py`: This script will remove assembly directories from the output folder for samples for which not all necessary files are present in the assembly folder. This is to remove them for samples which were run before we stored all necessary files to skip re-running the assembly in the pipeline.
  - `clean_up_preprocessing.py`: This script will remove the files generated by the phix filtering step of preprocessing from nextflow's work directory, provided that we do not need them anymore (i.e. we have the files in the output directory).
  - `clean_up_samples.py`: This script will remove everything related to certain samples from the work directory


### Eggnog annotations

The Eggnog annotation table is a bit complex to analyse as is, as it condenses many types of annotations. Notably for annotation types for which a given gene can have several annotations, the cells will contain coma-separated lists of annotations, e.g. `ko:K00336,ko:K01101`. To simplify analysis we provide a post-processing script ([annotations.py](https://github.com/metagenlab/zshoman/post_processing/annotations.py)) which will output a table for each annotation type, containing the annotation (e.g. `ko:K00336`) and its abundance in each sample.
